# Math problem annotation task

The file `task.txt` contains 8 word problems. Each word problem has the following sections:
 - input
 - prediction
 - correction
 - target

Given the `input`, a student generated the `prediction`. The correct solution is provided in `target`.

For four of the problems, a `correction` is provided by a teacher to fix the errors in the student's
`prediction` and to make the reasoning more correct, as in the `target`.

*Your task*: fill in the `correction` for the final four problems.
