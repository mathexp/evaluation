# Math problem translation task


## Overview

The file `evaluation.json` contains 6 word problems. Each word problem has the following sections:
 - index: identifier for the example
 - problem: problem statement
 - solution: solution to the problem

The first 2 word problems have corresponding `.py` files as examples for you to follow. These are `2729.py` and `4958.py`.

## Your task

Your task is to create python files that correspond to the other four problems in `evaluation.json`.

## Specifications
 - Each python file should match the format of the provided files as closely as possible.
 - You are encouraged to use libraries such as `math`, `sympy` and `itertools` and other useful common python libraries.
 - Try to make your python files as pedagogical as possible. Please include descriptive docstrings and comments.
 - Submit your files via email. **DO NOT open a pull request.**
